<!--
Authoring guide (delete this comment when done):

- The description above is the PRIMARY triggering mechanism. State what the
  skill does AND the concrete contexts where it applies. Claude tends to
  under-trigger skills, so be a little "pushy" — list the trigger phrases a
  real user would type.
- ALL "when to use" information belongs in the description, not the body.
  The body is only loaded after the skill has already triggered.
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. If you need more, layer it (progressive
  disclosure): references/ for docs loaded as needed, scripts/ for executable
  helpers, assets/ for files used in output.
- Write instructions in imperative form. Explain WHY things matter instead of
  heavy-handed MUSTs — the model reasons better from rationale than rules.
- After writing, test triggering with:
    skillevel init ${skill} && skillevel ${skill}
-->

# ${skill}

TODO — one-paragraph overview: what this skill helps with and the outcome it
produces.

## Instructions

TODO — the steps or principles Claude should follow, in imperative form.

## Examples

TODO — one or two realistic input/output examples (optional; delete if the
instructions stand on their own).
