# skillevel — design

A test runner for **Claude Code skills**. Think `vitest`, but a "test" is a
prompt and the thing under test is whether a skill fires (and behaves) the way
its author intended.

## Why

Skills are prompt-triggered and non-deterministic. Before shipping or editing
one, two things matter:

1. **Triggering** — does it fire on the prompts it should, and stay out of the
   near-misses it shouldn't (over/under-firing)?
2. (later) **Task quality** — does the skill actually make the output better?

`skillevel` v1 nails **#1**. It's cheap, fast, and the highest-frequency need.
Task-quality A/B grading is v2.

## Positioning

- A **standalone `npx` CLI** — not a Claude Code skill, not tied to one repo.
- It **adopts the community `evals/cases.yaml` schema** (from the `skill-eval`
  skill) rather than inventing one. Cases stay portable; skillevel is just the
  most ergonomic runner + scaffolder for them.
- Mental model: **vitest for skills**. Auto-discovery, `--watch`, reporters,
  `trials` = built-in flake handling, `--ci` = regression gate.

## Commands

```
skillevel                    # discover & run every eval (**/*.eval.yaml, evals/cases.yaml)
skillevel sql                # filter to a skill or a file
skillevel --watch            # re-run on SKILL.md / case changes (inner loop)
skillevel -t "negative"      # filter by case id/substring
skillevel --reporter junit   # grid (default) · dot · json · junit
skillevel --ci               # non-zero exit on any regression / unwritten case
skillevel init sql           # scaffold a cases file from the skill (template + guidance)
skillevel new sql            # scaffold sql/SKILL.md (template + authoring guidance)
skillevel lint [target...]   # validate SKILL.md files (errors) + guidance heuristics (warnings)
skillevel fmt [--check]      # conservative SKILL.md frontmatter/whitespace normalizer
```

## Case format (adopted from skill-eval)

```yaml
skill: sql # leaf name; must match the Skill tool's skill name
trials: 5 # runs per case (variance); per-case override allowed
# model: sonnet          # optional
# triggerThreshold: 0.8  # case is green if pass-rate >= this (default 0.8)
cases:
  - id: happy-1
    prompt: "..."
    should_trigger: true
    expect: # optional extra asserts, on top of the trigger check
      - triggered
      - match: "SELECT" # case-insensitive regex in the response
      - absent: "DELETE" # regex must NOT appear
      # - judge: "is the query read-only and correctly scoped?"  # LLM-graded (v1.1)
  - id: neg-1
    prompt: "..."
    should_trigger: false
    expect: [not_triggered]
```

- `should_trigger` is the **primary check**: did the target skill fire?
- `triggered` / `not_triggered` in `expect` are redundant shorthands (validated
  against `should_trigger`); `match` / `absent` / `judge` add output checks.
- A **placeholder prompt** (contains `<...>`) marks the case as _unwritten_ — it
  is reported as TODO and fails `--ci`, so `init` output can't silently pass.

## `init` — scaffold, don't generate

`init` is **offline and deterministic**. It does NOT ask an LLM to invent cases
(auto-generated cases plant plausible-but-wrong tests). It:

1. reads the target `SKILL.md` (dev copy in cwd if present, else installed),
2. pre-fills `skill:` from the frontmatter `name`,
3. writes example happy + near-miss-negative cases as clearly-marked
   placeholders, with the authoring principles inline, and
4. pulls the skill's own **trigger keywords verbatim** into a comment as a hint.

The human writes the real cases — ideally from real usage/production traces.

## Authoring toolchain — `new` / `lint` / `fmt`

The same philosophy as `init`: **offline and deterministic**, templates and
guidance only — never LLM-invented content.

- `new` writes a starter `SKILL.md` whose placeholders are honest TODOs and
  whose authoring guidance (triggering description, 500-line limit, progressive
  disclosure) rides along as a deletable comment.
- `lint` splits its findings by authority: **errors** are the packaging /
  validation rules (ported from skill-creator's `quick_validate.py` — a skill
  that fails them won't install cleanly); **warnings** are authoring guidance
  (unwritten descriptions, leftover placeholders, broken `references/` paths,
  over-length bodies) — judgement calls, so they never fail the exit code.
- `fmt` is deliberately conservative: it normalises frontmatter key order and
  whitespace, and when it can't parse the frontmatter it returns the file
  untouched — the linter reports the problem; the formatter never destroys
  content.

## Run mechanism

For each case × trial, shell out to:

```
claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format stream-json --verbose [--model M] [--max-turns N]
```

Parse the NDJSON stream: a `tool_use` block named `Skill` carries the fired
skill in `input.skill`; the terminating `result` event carries the final text
and `total_cost_usd`. (Schema verified on Claude Code 2.1.x.)

**Early-exit** (cost saver, borrowed from skill-creator's `run_eval.py`): when a
case has only trigger checks,

- `should_trigger: true` → kill the process the moment the target skill fires
  (fast pass);
- `should_trigger: false` → kill the moment _any_ skill fires (fast fail);
  otherwise run to completion (needed for `match`/`absent`/`judge`), with a low
  `--max-turns` to bound negatives.

## Scoring

- A **trial** passes if the trigger direction matches `should_trigger` and every
  `expect` assert passes.
- A **case**'s score is `passes / trials`; it is green when
  `>= triggerThreshold` (default 0.8), so a single flake doesn't fail it.
- `--ci` exits non-zero if any case is below threshold or unwritten.

## Which version of the skill is tested (v1 limitation)

v1 tests whatever `claude -p` **already discovers** (installed
`~/.claude/skills`, project `.claude/skills`, plugins). To test a working-copy
edit, install/symlink it. **Roadmap:** `--skill-dir <path>` sets up an isolated
temp project (`.claude/skills/<name>` + `--bare`) so you can eval an uncommitted
SKILL.md reproducibly, and skill-on/off ablation for task-quality (v2).

## Non-goals (v1)

- Task-quality A/B grading / lift (v2).
- Multi-harness (Cursor/Codex/Gemini) — v1 is `claude -p` only.
- HTML report — terminal + JSON first.

---

# v2 — task-quality A/B (does the skill actually help?)

v1 answers _does it trigger_. v2 answers _does it improve the output_ — the
question that decides whether a skill is worth its tokens, and whether an edit
made it better. This is the ablation `skill-eval` describes and the A/B loop the
official `skill-creator` runs, packaged as one command.

## The idea

For each case, run the **same prompt twice** — once with the skill available,
once without — grade both outputs, and report the **lift**:

```
$ skillevel bench sql          # or: skillevel sql --ablate

sql  ./sql.eval.yaml
  case                 with   without   lift
  aggregate-revenue    5/5      2/5      +60pp
  safe-delete          5/5      5/5       0pp     ← model already handles this
  ...
  ▲ skill lift: +34pp   (48% → 82%)   $1.10
```

- lift ≫ 0 → the skill earns its place.
- lift ≈ 0 across the board → **retire candidate** (the model already does it);
  keep the cases as a regression guard, per `skill-eval`.

## Cases

No new file format — a v2 case is a v1 case whose `expect` carries **output**
assertions instead of (or on top of) the trigger check:

```yaml
- id: aggregate-revenue
  prompt: "What was revenue by month last quarter?"
  should_trigger: true
  expect:
    - judge: "Produces a correct GROUP BY month aggregate, read-only"
    - match: "GROUP BY"
```

`judge` is graded PASS/FAIL by an LLM with **quoted evidence** (borrowed from
`skill-creator`'s grader: burden of proof on the assertion, no partial credit).
Trigger-only cases are skipped by `bench` — there's nothing to compare.

## The "without skill" arm — the hard part, honestly

Two ways to run the baseline, each with a caveat:

1. **Blunt (v2.0):** `--disallowedTools Skill` blocks _all_ skills. Cheap and
   reliable, but measures "this skill vs no skills", not "vs this one skill
   removed". Fine when the case wouldn't pull in a sibling anyway.
2. **Isolated (v2.1):** reuse the v1 `--skill-dir` roadmap — a temp project whose
   `.claude/skills/` contains everything _except_ the skill under test, run with
   `--bare`. True per-skill ablation; more setup.

Run the two arms **in the same batch/turn** (as `skill-creator` does) so
time-of-day and model drift hit both equally.

## Grading & aggregation

- **Grader:** one `claude -p` call per output, model-graded against the case's
  `judge`/rubric expectations. `match`/`absent` still apply as cheap gates.
- **Aggregation:** a `benchmark.json` keyed by **config name** (`with_skill` /
  `without_skill`) rather than hardcoded arms — the same aggregator then also
  serves **old-vs-new-version** comparison (point one arm at a snapshotted
  SKILL.md). Report mean ± stddev of pass-rate, plus cost and tokens.

## CLI surface

```
skillevel bench <skill>            # with vs without, report lift
skillevel bench <skill> --vs <ref> # with vs a snapshotted old version
skillevel bench <skill> --html     # richer report (optional)
```

Everything else (discovery, `trials`, reporters, `--ci`) carries over
unchanged. `--ci` on `bench` can gate on "lift must stay ≥ X" to catch a skill
edit that quietly regresses quality.

## Open questions

- Judge variance — grade N times and vote, or trust one call with evidence?
- Cost — `bench` is ~2× the runs plus a grader call each; make `trials` default
  lower for `bench` than for trigger evals.
- Comparator vs per-output grader — a blind A/B "which is better" (skill-creator's
  `comparator`) can be more discriminating than independent PASS/FAIL, but is
  harder to threshold in CI. Start with the grader; add comparator behind a flag.
